# Variables used in the script "run_analysis.R"

train: dataframe with the train sample data, with all variables originally measured.
test: dataframe with the test sample data, with all variables originally measured.
data: complete dataframe, envolving the data from train and test samples.
features: dataframe with the labels of the 561 variables in the original data set.
names: Used to refer to the feature column that contains the variable names from the original data set.
datameansd: Date subset, containing only the variables of mean and standard deviation of the variables.
acttrain: Vector with activity labels for each train set observation. It can be from 1 to 6 (1 WALKING, 
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

, 5 STANDING
, 6 LAYING
)
acttest: Vector with activity labels for each test set observation. It can be from 1 to 6 (1 WALKING, 
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
, 4 SITTING
, 5 STANDING
, 6 LAYING
)
act: Vector with activity labels for all observations. It can be from 1 to 6 (1 WALKING,

# Guidelines
Set directory containing the data .txt files with the names shown in this code book.Run the script "run_analysis.R". Remembering that the files were taken from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" (Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.
